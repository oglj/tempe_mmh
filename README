This repository contains the R code that comprises the Collablocation module for locating micromobility hubs in Tempe, Arizona, U.S.A. 

It consists of two R files: app.R and global.R. I've edited out any passwords and API keys; you'll need to source your own accounts and keys to adapt this code.

This repository also contains the directory /www that Shiny uses to store additional assets, such as PNGs and shapefiles. The /www directory hosted on this repository contains the PNG icons and the spatial data layers used in this project.

I used the Shiny package to construct an interactive and responsive framework, the Leaflet package for geospatial data visualization, and MongoDB for remote data storage and retrieval. 

This repository does NOT contain:
- MongoDB database architecture
- reference to the overall geodesign process, of which this platform is only part. Visit collablocation.shinyapps.io/home, igc-geodesign.org, or esri.com/en-us/arcgis/geodesign for more info

I've done my best to provide helpful comments and code clearly throughout the project. That said, I rushed to finalize a working version and there may be some unclear sections. I hope to add additional comments in the near future. I apologize for any incoherence, and ask that you direct any inquiries to oglj@asu.edu

Thank you, and best,
-Oscar
