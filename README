This repository contains the R code that comprises the Collablocation module for locating micromobility hubs in Tempe, Arizona, U.S.A. It consists of two files: app.R and global.R. I've edited out any passwords and API keys; you'll need to source your own accounts and keys to adapt this code.

This repository does NOT contain:
- the MongoDB database architecture required for the module to function
- the spatial datasets required for the module to function
- the .png files used for icons throughout the module

I've done my best to provide helpful comments and code clearly throughout the project. That said, I rushed to finalize a working version and there may be some unclear sections. I apologize for any incoherence, and ask that you direct any inquiries to oglj@asu.edu

Thank you, and best,
-Oscar
